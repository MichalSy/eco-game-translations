"Atmosphere pressure used in the atmosphere size formula. Trees absorb and pollution from tables produced in tons and converted to PPM by dividing on total atmosphere size. AtmosphereSizeInTons = WorldAreaInM2 * AtmospherePressureKgPerM2 where WorldAreaInM2 = (Dimensions.x * 10) * (Dimensions.y * 10). In example for 1km² (1000000m²) world with atmosphere pressure 1 kg/m² it will be 1000000 tons, resulting in 1 PPM per 1 ton of pollution or absorb (1 PPM =  1000000 * tons / AtmosphereSizeInTons), increasing pressure to 2 will result in 0.5 PPM per ton.","大气压公式中使用的大气压。树木吸收并污染了以吨为单位的餐桌，并通过除以大气总大小将其转换为百万分率。 AtmosphereSizeInTons = WorldAreaInM2 * AtmospherePressureKgPerM2，其中WorldAreaInM2 =（Dimensions.x * 10）*（Dimensions.y * 10）。例如，对于大气压力为1 公斤 /m²的1km²（1000000m²）世界，将为1000000吨，即每1吨污染物或吸收量产生1 百万分率（1 百万分率 = 1000000 *吨/ AtmosphereSizeInTons），将压力增加到2将导致每吨0.5 百万分率。"
